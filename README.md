This project is a test space where I am exploring some new technologies as well as testing out new react stratigies and best practices.

This project was bootstrapped with [Custom React Scrips](https://www.npmjs.com/package/custom-react-scripts).

This gives you a `.env` file so you can still easily customize the `webpack.config`. I needed this too explore ES7 decorators.

See above link for more tips on things you can add to the `.env` file.

If you clone this project you will need to create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add this configs:

```
REACT_APP_DECORATORS=true
REACT_APP_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT=**********
```


So far it includes:

[Graph.Cool](https://www.graph.cool/)

[Apollo for React](http://www.apollodata.com/)

[react jss](https://github.com/cssinjs/react-jss)

[React Router v 4](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/quick-start)



I am also using it to explore Higher Order Components as well as the Recompose library.

Not yet implemented but coming soon.
