This project was bootstrapped with [Custom React Scrips](https://www.npmjs.com/package/custom-react-scripts).

This gives you a `.env` file so you can still easily customize the webpack.config. I needed this too explore ES7 decorators.


It is a test space where I am exploring some of the latest and greatest tools and technologies, and practices.

So far it includes:
[Graph.Cool]https://www.graph.cool/)

[Apollo for React](http://www.apollodata.com/)

[react jss](https://github.com/cssinjs/react-jss)

[React Router v 4](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/quick-start)



I am also using it to explore Higher Order Components as well as the Recompose library.

Not yet implemented but coming soon.
